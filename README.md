# Overview

You have a 4x4 grid, each cell containing a single-digit number on a button. At the top of the screen, a target total is displayed. The goal is to activate a combination of buttons so that their sum equals the target number.

A timer adds pressure, encouraging quick mental math. The main gameplay loop is to complete as many correct totals as possible within the time limit to set a high score.
